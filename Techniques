1)QUICK SORT
------------

-Algorithm (Step-by-Step Explanation)

    Pick a Pivot: Choose any element in the array (e.g., the first, last, or middle element).

    Partition: Rearrange the array such that:
        All elements smaller than the pivot go to its left.
        All elements larger go to its right.

    Recursively Apply Quick Sort: Apply quick sort to the left and right sub-arrays.

    Base Case: Stop when the array or sub-array has 0 or 1 element (it's already sorted).


2)MERGE SORT
------------
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm used to sort an array or list. It breaks the array into smaller parts, sorts them individually, 
and then merges them back together into a sorted array.


3)COUNTING SORT
----------------

Counting Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that organizes elements by counting how many times each unique value occurs. 
Itâ€™s most effective when sorting integers or data with a small range of values.


4)RADIX SORT
------------

Radix Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by sorting numbers digit by digit,
starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). 
It uses another stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) as a subroutine to sort the digits.


5)BUCKET SORT
-------------

Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the input array into several "buckets," 
sorts each bucket individually (often using another sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort), 
and then combines the sorted buckets to produce the final sorted array
