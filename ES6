ES6
---
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced major new features to JavaScript, 
making the language more powerful, modern, and easier to write and maintain. 

1)Template Literal
------------------
Template Literals in JavaScript

Template literals, introduced in ES6, provide a cleaner and more flexible way to work with strings. 
They use backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes and allow for features like string interpolation,
multiline strings, and embedding expressions directly within strings.

eg:
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`);
// Output: "The sum of 5 and 10 is 15."


2)Destructuring
---------------
Destructuring is a feature introduced in ES6 that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects
and assign them to variables in a cleaner and more concise way.
Itâ€™s often used to simplify the extraction of values from complex structures like objects and arrays.
