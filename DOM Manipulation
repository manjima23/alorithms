DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
---------------------
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents.
It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects where each object corresponds to an element or attribute in the page.

Key concepts:
-Tree strucutre
-nodes(HTML Tags)
-Accessing the DOM

Basic DOM manipulation methods
------------------------------
1) Selecting elements:
-document.getElementById(): Selects an element by its id.
-document.getElementsByClassName(): Selects elements by their class name.
-document.getElementsByTagName(): Selects elements by their tag name (e.g., div, p, h1).
-document.querySelector(): Selects the first matching element using CSS selectors.
-document.querySelectorAll(): Selects all matching elements using CSS selectors.

2)Adding  elements:
-document.CreateElement
-append
-appendChild
-TO ADD TEXT TO THE NEW ELEMENT-Inner text ,text content, inner html

3)Remove elements from the DOM


EVENT HANDLING
---------------
Event handling in JavaScript refers to the process of capturing and responding to events, such as clicks, key presses,
mouse movements, and other user interactions or browser actions. 
When an event occurs, JavaScript can "handle" it by running a function (also called an event handler or callback function) in response.
